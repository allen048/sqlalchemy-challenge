# sqlalchemy-challenge

This assignment involved creating a climate analysis of my long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. It involved using Python and SQLAlchemy to complete this task. I used a climate database to manage the information. To complete this assignment I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

I designed a Flask API based on the queries I developed for this project. I used JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to transmit the data into a web application. Based on the queries I created in the beginning of this assignment, I was able to create webpages that contained this data.
